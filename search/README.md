# CS50W Project 0: Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

#### Video Demo:

#### Description:

The project contains three pages that clone Google's search pages. Using only HTML and CSS.

- index.html: Google Search (in dark mode) using dark-mode.css
- images.html: Google Image Search (in light mode) using light-mode.css
- advanced.html: Google Advanced Search (in dark mode) using dark-mode.css

#### Future Improvements:

- Use SCSS to define mutual variables
- Define common CSS used in both dark-mode.css and light-mode.css
