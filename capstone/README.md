# CS50W Final Project - Capstone

## Description
Design an inventory and sales operations app which allow users to manage products and sales.

Key features:
- Sales/Orders: create orders and invoices
- Products: register and manage products
- Customer: create and manage customers
- Reports: view reports such as sales, stock on hand

## Distinctiveness


## Complexity


## Future Improvements
- Add filter and sorting to Warehouses using list.js or django-filter
- Report: View by product, add product view
- Allow creating a new customer when creating a new sales order
- TODO: create sales order: select warehouse to populate available products; allow select multiple products
