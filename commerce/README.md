# CS50W Project 2 - Commerce
## Description
Design an auction site that allows users to post listings, place bids, comment, and add listings to a “watchlist.”

#### Future Improvements
- Use bootstrap to style forms (e.g. create-listing form) created by Django. Perhaps using django-crispy-forms
- Add sort/filter functionality for listings
- Search function
- User profile and a hyperlink to an owner's page  that shows all their lisings
- Show number of watchlist on the navigation menu once logged in
